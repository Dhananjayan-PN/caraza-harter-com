# STEP 1: Copy and paste code for reading JSON file.
 
# STEP 2: Copy and paste code for writing JSON file. 
#         Eliminate duplicate import.

# STEP 3: Process player name, player score as a command line
#         arguments using sys module.

# STEP 4: Define an empty "scores" dictionary to keep track of players'
#         scores.
#         KEY: player name VALUE: player scores list

# STEP 5: Check if player name is a key in the scores dictionary.
#         If not, create a new key for player name and value as empty list
#         to keep track of that player's scores.

# STEP 6: Add player's score to the player's list in scores dictionary

# STEP 7: Create a "score_history.json" file and popluate that file with
#         empty dictionary {}

# STEP 8: Read "score_history.json" to populate initial "scores" dict, 
#         instead of the empty dict created in STEP 4.

# STEP 9: Calculate average score for that player

# STEP 10: At the end of the program, write the updated scores from dict
#         into the "scores_history.json" file

# STEP 11: That's it, now you have a program that helps you keep track 
#          of player scores permanently.
